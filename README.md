# Week #1 Assignment
## Transcription

One of my favorite scenes in films is the scene from Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket".
The film tells the story of soldiers being sent to Vietnam.
In this scene we see new recruits for the Marine Corps being brutally discipline by their drill-sergeat.
In one of the best rantings in film history, The drill sergeant just bombs them with violant, racist, foul mouth speach.
Since I really love this scene, I really wanted to try and transcribe it, by listening of course. 
Unfortunatelly, this is a little bit too offensive so I decided to try and transcribe something else.

I'm taking a class at cinema studies here at Tisch, and last week we saw the film "They shoot horses, don't they?".
At last minute, I decided to transcribe the dialogs between the two main charaters.
Here I decided to do the first dialouges as dry as I can, in order to emphasize the scenary in the last one.
It got me to think - Does describing scenary counts as transcribig? Is representing the settings and physical reactions a part of the transcriber's roll? I don't know. sometime it has no meaning and sometimes it's crucial. 

In the middle, I tried to transcribe an interview with George Harrison in 1971. I realized that transcribing
a real conversation is much harder then transcribing a scripted monolouge/dialogue. In the interview or in a more realistic conversation there are a lot of overlaping sentences, phonetic expressions, and unintelligable phrases. For this transcription task the denaturalization format would be more suitable, but is much harder to preform.
