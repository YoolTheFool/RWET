# Week #1 Assignment
## Transcription

One of my favorite scenes in films is the scene from Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket".
The film tells the story of soldiers being sent to Vietnam.
In this scene we see new recruits for the Marine Corps being brutally discipline by their drill-sergeat.
In one of the best rantings in film history, The drill sergeant just bombs them with violant, racist, foul mouth speach.
Since I really love this scene, I really wanted to try and transcribe it, by listening of course. 
Unfortunatelly, this is a little bit too offensive so I decided to try and transcribe something else.

I'm taking a class at cinema studies here at Tisch, and last week we saw the film "They shoot horses, don't they?".
At last minute, I decided to transcribe the dialogs between the two main charaters.
Here I decided to do the first dialouges as dry as I can, in order to emphasize the scenary in the last one.
It got me to think - Does describing scenary counts as transcribig? Is representing the settings and physical reactions a part of the transcriber's roll? I don't know. sometime it has no meaning and sometimes it's crucial.

In the middle, I tried to transcribe an interview with George Harrison in 1971. I realized that transcribing
a real conversation is much harder then transcribing a scripted monolouge/dialogue. In the interview or in a more realistic conversation there are a lot of overlaping sentences, phonetic expressions, and unintelligable phrases. For this transcription task the denaturalization format would be more suitable, but is much harder to preform. In some cases when I was trying to figure out what George is saying, since his so quiet, I just filled in words that I thought he would say. That gives out his humbling cinical nature. That made me feel really powerfull.

This takes me to the reading about the politics of transcription. Some thoughts I had on that:
 - I understand that the roll of the transcriber is much more than simply write down what she/he feels. I understand that it's important to have responsbilty as a transcriber and as a reader. But there are places that I relly want to see just the words and not feel like I'm being manipulated by some one. I think that the only way to do that is with technology. After reading this article, I really see transcription as a form of art, as an expressiv medium of writing. But there are instences in which the importance of the dry words and the phonetic way they were pronounced is too critical. Like the police interrogation instance. 
 - I feel that today, these matters are getting less common since the better quality of recrodings and videos. People are less reading and more listening and watching. There's no fooling you there. Or perhaps there's more manipulation in videos and recordings. Is't a big question. 
 - Now that I understand my biases for the written word of interviews and speaches, I feel I have more ways to engage such a thing and widen my prespective.
